1)What does the dollar($) sign do?
In Excel, the dollar sign ($) is used to create an absolute cell reference in a formula.An absolute cell reference refers to a specific cell in a worksheet, 
regardless of where the formula is copied or moved. 

2)How to Change the Reference from Relative to Absolute (or Mixed)?
You can change a cell reference in Excel from relative to absolute (or mixed) by adding dollar signs ($) before the column letter, the row number, 
or both, depending on the type of reference you want to create. 

3)Explain the order of operations in excel?
The order of operations in Excel determines the sequence in which calculations are performed in a formula.
Excel follows a specific order of operations to ensure that calculations are performed in the correct order, regardless of the complexity of the formula. 
The order of operations in Excel is as follows:
Parentheses,Exponents,Multiplication and Division,Addition and Subtraction.
For example, consider the following formula: =13+5*3^2/(12+4)=13+5*3^2/16=13+5*9/16=13+45/16=57/16=3.56

4)What, according to you, are the top 5 functions in excel and write a basic syntax for any of two?
1-SUM: Adds the values of one or more cells.
Syntax: =SUM(number1,[number2],...)
2-AVERAGE: Calculates the average of the values in a range of cells.
Syntax: =AVERAGE(number1,[number2],...)
3-IF: Tests a condition and returns one value if the condition is true, and another value if the condition is false.
Syntax: =IF(logical_test,value_if_true,value_if_false)
4-VLOOKUP: Searches for a value in the first column of a table, and returns a value in the same row from a specified column.
Syntax: =VLOOKUP(lookup_value,table_array,col_index_num,range_lookup)
5-CONCATENATE: Joins two or more text strings into one string.
Syntax: =CONCATENATE(text1,[text2],...)

5)When would you use the subtotal function?
The SUBTOTAL function in Excel is useful for calculating subtotals for a range of data. 
The SUBTOTAL function is especially useful when working with large data sets or databases, where you need to analyze specific portions of the data. 
It can be used to calculate the subtotal for each group within the data, or for specific columns within a table.
For example, suppose you have a large data set that contains sales figures for various regions and products, and you want to calculate the total sales for each region. 
You can use the SUBTOTAL function to calculate the subtotal for each region. The function can ignore any hidden or filtered rows, which makes it easier to get accurate results.

Here is an example of the syntax for the SUBTOTAL function:
=SUBTOTAL(function_num, ref1, [ref2], ...)

6)What is the syntax of the vlookup function? Explain the terms in it?
The syntax of the VLOOKUP function in Excel is as follows:
=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])
where;lookup_value: This is the value that you want to look up in the leftmost column of the table.
table_array: This is the range of cells that contains the data you want to look up.
col_index_num: This is the column number in the table_array that contains the data you want to retrieve. 
range_lookup: This is an optional argument that indicates whether you want an exact match or an approximate match for the lookup_value.
