When you open the Excel interface, you will see a spreadsheet application that is designed for organizing, manipulating, and analyzing data. 
Here are some of the key things that you may notice after opening Excel:
1-A grid of cells: The main area of the Excel interface is a grid of cells that are arranged in rows and columns. Each cell has a unique cell reference, 
which is identified by a combination of a letter and a number, such as A1, B2, C3, and so on.
2-A ribbon: At the top of the Excel interface, you will see a ribbon that contains tabs and groups of commands. 
The tabs are organized by activity, such as "Home," "Insert," "Page Layout," "Formulas," "Data," and "Review."

6)When to use a relative cell reference in excel?
Relative cell reference is used when you want the formula to refer to a cell relative to the location of the cell that contains the formula.
eg:-For example, suppose you have a formula in cell B2 that multiplies the value in cell A2 by 2, and you want to copy the formula to cell B3. 
If you use a relative cell reference in the formula, such as "=A22", then when you copy the formula to cell B3, the formula will automatically adjust to "=A32", which refers to the cell one row below the original cell.
